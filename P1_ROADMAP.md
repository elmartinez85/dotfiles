## P1-1: Profile Switch Detection & Cleanup

### Current Problem
When switching from `personal` to `work` profile (or vice versa):
- **Apps from BOTH profiles remain installed**
  - Personal: Discord, Cursor, Obsidian, Mullvad Browser, Calibre
  - Work: Chrome, Firefox Dev, Espanso, Bruno
  - Result: ALL apps installed = wasted disk space + potential conflicts
- **No warning about destructive changes**
- **No confirmation prompt**
- **Can't rollback if something goes wrong**

### Example Scenario
```bash
# User has personal profile installed
./bootstrap.sh --profile personal  # Discord, Cursor, Obsidian installed

# User switches to work
./bootstrap.sh --profile work      # Chrome, Firefox, Espanso added
                                   # BUT Discord, Cursor, Obsidian REMAIN!
```

### What Needs to Happen
1. **Detect profile switch:**
   ```bash
   OLD_PROFILE=$(cat .profile_active 2>/dev/null)
   if [ "$OLD_PROFILE" != "$PROFILE" ] && [ -n "$OLD_PROFILE" ]; then
       # This is a profile switch, not fresh install
   fi
   ```

2. **Show what will change:**
   ```
   Switching from personal to work

   Apps to be REMOVED:
     • Discord
     • Cursor
     • Obsidian
     • Mullvad Browser
     • Calibre

   Apps to be ADDED:
     • Google Chrome
     • Firefox Developer Edition
     • Espanso
     • Bruno

   Configuration changes:
     • Git email will change
     • SSH hosts will change
     • AeroSpace keybindings will change (Alt+d → Alt+b)
   ```

3. **Get confirmation:**
   ```bash
   read -p "Continue with profile switch? [y/N] " -n 1 -r
   ```

4. **Backup before switch:**
   ```bash
   backup_dir=".backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$OLD_PROFILE"
   mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
   # Copy configs that will change
   ```

5. **Uninstall old profile apps:**
   ```bash
   # Compare Brewfile.additions files
   # Uninstall apps only in old profile
   brew uninstall --cask discord cursor obsidian mullvad-browser calibre
   ```

### Implementation Complexity
- **Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk:** Medium (need careful Brewfile comparison logic)
- **Impact:** High (prevents app accumulation, better UX)

## P1-2: System Requirements Check

### Current Problem
Bootstrap assumes:
- ❌ macOS is installed (no Linux/Windows check)
- ❌ Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (git, make, etc.)
- ❌ User has admin/sudo access
- ❌ 1Password is installed (for SSH agent)
- ❌ Sufficient disk space available
- ❌ Internet connectivity

**Result:** Cryptic failures halfway through installation

### What Needs to Happen

Add pre-flight system checks BEFORE validation:

```bash
print_step "System Requirements Check"

# Check 1: macOS
if [[ "$OSTYPE" != "darwin"* ]]; then
    print_error "This script only works on macOS"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 2: macOS version (require 12.0+)
macos_version=$(sw_vers -productVersion | cut -d. -f1)
if [[ $macos_version -lt 12 ]]; then
    print_error "macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or higher required"
    print_info "Your version: $(sw_vers -productVersion)"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 3: Xcode Command Line Tools
if ! xcode-select -p &> /dev/null; then
    print_warning "Xcode Command Line Tools not installed"
    print_info "Installing now (this will take a few minutes)..."
    xcode-select --install
    print_info "Please complete the Xcode CLT installation and run this script again"
    exit 0
fi

# Check 4: 1Password (optional but recommended)
if [ ! -S "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock" ]; then
    print_warning "1Password SSH agent not detected"
    print_info "SSH key management will not work without 1Password"
    read -p "Continue anyway? [y/N] " -n 1 -r
    echo
    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        exit 0
    fi
fi

# Check 5: Internet connectivity
if ! ping -c 1 google.com &> /dev/null; then
    print_error "No internet connection detected"
    print_info "Internet is required to download Homebrew and packages"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 6: Disk space (need at least 5GB)
available_space=$(df -g / | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
if [[ $available_space -lt 5 ]]; then
    print_error "Insufficient disk space (${available_space}GB available)"
    print_info "At least 5GB free space required"
    exit 1
fi

print_success "All system requirements met!"
```

### Implementation Complexity
- **Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)
- **Risk:** Low (only checks, doesn't modify)
- **Impact:** High (prevents confusing failures)

---

## P1-3: Update Mode vs Reinstall Mode

### Current Problem
Running bootstrap on already-installed profile:
- Reinstalls ALL Homebrew packages (slow, 5-10 minutes)
- Re-runs ALL configuration steps (unnecessary)
- No intelligence about what changed
- No way to just update packages

### What Needs to Happen

Add mode detection and smart updates:

```bash
# Detect existing installation
if [ -f "$DOTFILES_DIR/.profile_active" ]; then
    CURRENT_PROFILE=$(cat "$DOTFILES_DIR/.profile_active")

    if [ "$CURRENT_PROFILE" == "$PROFILE" ]; then
        # Same profile - offer update mode
        print_warning "Profile '$PROFILE' is already installed"
        echo ""
        echo "Choose installation mode:"
        echo "  [u] Update - Only update packages and refresh configs (fast)"
        echo "  [r] Reinstall - Complete reinstall of everything (slow)"
        echo "  [c] Cancel"
        echo ""
        read -p "Select mode [u/r/c]: " -n 1 -r
        echo ""

        case $REPLY in
            u|U)
                INSTALL_MODE="update"
                print_info "Running in UPDATE mode"
                ;;
            r|R)
                INSTALL_MODE="reinstall"
                print_info "Running in REINSTALL mode"
                ;;
            c|C)
                print_info "Installation cancelled"
                exit 0
                ;;
            *)
                print_error "Invalid choice"
                exit 1
                ;;
        esac
    else
        # Different profile - this is a switch
        INSTALL_MODE="switch"
        PREVIOUS_PROFILE="$CURRENT_PROFILE"
    fi
else
    # No previous installation
    INSTALL_MODE="fresh"
fi

# Then in each step, check mode:

# Example: Step 2 - Homebrew packages
if [[ "$INSTALL_MODE" == "update" ]]; then
    print_info "Updating packages only..."
    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew bundle --file="$MERGED_BREWFILE" --no-lock
else
    print_info "Installing packages..."
    brew bundle --file="$MERGED_BREWFILE"
fi

# Example: Step 11 - macOS defaults
if [[ "$INSTALL_MODE" == "fresh" ]]; then
    # Only apply on fresh install
    print_info "Setting macOS preferences..."
    # ... defaults write commands
else
    print_info "Skipping macOS defaults (already configured)"
fi
```

### Benefits
- **Update mode:** 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes
- **Clearer intent:** User knows what's happening
- **Safer:** Less chance of breaking working setup

### Implementation Complexity
- **Effort:** Medium (3-4 hours)
- **Risk:** Medium (need to test all combinations)
- **Impact:** High (much better UX for existing users)

## P1-4: Proper Error Handling

### Current Problem
Silent failures throughout the script:
```bash
codium --install-extension "$extension" 2>/dev/null  # Hides errors!
```

No error accumulation or final report:
- VSCodium extensions fail silently
- Some symlinks might fail
- brew bundle errors might be missed
- User doesn't know what succeeded/failed

### What Needs to Happen

1. **Track failures:**
```bash
# At start of script
ERRORS=()
WARNINGS=()

# Throughout script
install_extension() {
    local ext=$1
    if ! codium --install-extension "$ext" 2>&1 | grep -q "successfully installed"; then
        WARNINGS+=("Failed to install VSCodium extension: $ext")
        return 1
    fi
    return 0
}

# At end of script
if [ ${#WARNINGS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    print_warning "Installation completed with warnings:"
    for warning in "${WARNINGS[@]}"; do
        echo "  ⚠ $warning"
    done
fi

if [ ${#ERRORS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    print_error "Installation completed with errors:"
    for error in "${ERRORS[@]}"; do
        echo "  ✗ $error"
    done
    exit 1
fi
```

2. **Better Homebrew error handling:**
```bash
if ! brew bundle --file="$MERGED_BREWFILE"; then
    ERRORS+=("Homebrew package installation failed")
    print_error "Some packages failed to install"
    print_info "Run 'brew bundle --file=$MERGED_BREWFILE' to see details"

    # Continue anyway? Ask user
    read -p "Continue with configuration? [y/N] " -n 1 -r
    echo
    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

3. **Validate critical dependencies:**
```bash
# After Homebrew install, verify critical tools
CRITICAL_TOOLS=("git" "zsh" "starship" "fzf")
for tool in "${CRITICAL_TOOLS[@]}"; do
    if ! command -v "$tool" &> /dev/null; then
        ERRORS+=("Critical tool not installed: $tool")
    fi
done
```

4. **Remove silent error suppression:**
```bash
# BAD (current):
codium --install-extension "$extension" 2>/dev/null

# GOOD (proposed):
if ! codium --install-extension "$extension" 2>&1; then
    WARNINGS+=("Extension failed: $extension")
fi
```

### Implementation Complexity
- **Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk:** Low (mostly additive changes)
- **Impact:** High (users know what went wrong)

## Estimated Total Effort

- **P1-1:** 2-3 hours
- **P1-2:** 1-2 hours
- **P1-3:** 3-4 hours
- **P1-4:** 2-3 hours

**Total: 8-12 hours** (1-2 full days of work)

## Testing Plan for Each P1

### P1-1: Profile Switch
- ✅ Fresh install personal → switch to work → verify apps
- ✅ Fresh install work → switch to personal → verify apps
- ✅ Switch back and forth multiple times
- ✅ Cancel during switch
- ✅ Verify backups created

### P1-2: System Requirements
- ✅ Run on fresh macOS (no Xcode CLT)
- ✅ Run with no internet
- ✅ Run with low disk space (VM)
- ✅ Run without 1Password
- ✅ Run on older macOS version

### P1-3: Update Mode
- ✅ Fresh install → run again → choose update
- ✅ Fresh install → run again → choose reinstall
- ✅ Update mode with outdated packages
- ✅ Verify update is faster than reinstall

### P1-4: Error Handling
- ✅ Simulate brew bundle failure
- ✅ Simulate extension install failure
- ✅ Simulate symlink failure
- ✅ Verify errors reported at end
- ✅ Verify script exits with error code

---

## Alternative: Incremental Implementation

If you want to tackle these one at a time:

**Week 1:** P1-2 (System Requirements) - Prevents frustration on fresh installs
**Week 2:** P1-4 (Error Handling) - Better debugging for you and users
**Week 3:** P1-3 (Update Mode) - Better daily experience
**Week 4:** P1-1 (Profile Switch) - Most complex, saved for last

This spreads the work out while delivering value incrementally.
